# Wrapped Playlist IDs (format: pl_YEAR=<playlist_id>)
# Get playlist IDs from Spotify Web or use right-click > Share > Copy Spotify URI
# Example:
#   - Right-click the playlist in Spotify
#   - Select "Share" > "Copy Spotify URI"
#   - The ID is the part after "playlist/". You can delete everything before it.
#   - example with a random playlist: 
#       - Full link without share ID: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1p2iCmISwWEdgK54iAPe9F
#       -                          ---[     delete all this here      ]---
#       - Retain only '1p2iCmISwWEdgK54iAPe9F'. That is the Playlist ID we require
#
# For Wrapped playlists:
#   - up to 2021: Directly available as a usable, "normal" playlist.
#   - 2022+     : Create a new playlist by selecting all songs from your Wrapped for the year, right click and Add to Playlist
#           Spotify changed how they create Wrapped playlists, so the API cannot touch them anymore directly.
#
# Set each year's playlist ID:
# Delete whichever years are unavilable to you
