# Spotify Wrapped Insights

This is a Jupyter Notebook and .py script to extract your Spotify Wrapped playlist data and generate insights from the created dataset. Analytics insights are WIP.

## Setting up the script to get your dataset:
1. Setup venv/poetry. 
2. Define environment variables: CLIENT_ID and SECRET_ID. Get them through the Spotify Developer Console.
3. pl_{year} is the format for all playlist URIs, also defined in .env. Refer to playlists.py for more setup information.

All other necessary information is documented as markdown in the .ipynb file.
